			<p class="description">What is this tool for and why is it special?</p>
			<article id="information-section">
				<p>The ultimate, free, online size comparison maker for comparing the scale and shape of hundreds of objects and items! If you're curious about the width, length, or height dimensions or relative sizes of objects, this web tool makes getting data and comparing objects a breeze! With objects ranging from the minuscule atom to the grandeur of the Observable Universe, the sky-piercing Burj Khalifa to the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean, this free compare tool allows you to generate comparisons of nearly anything and is the ONLY one of its kind!</p><br>
				<p>With a vast database featuring hundreds of objects, you can easily explore side-by-side comparisons between a Cessna Skyhawk and a Boeing 747, or even delve into the intricacies of a human and a ladybug! This easy and versatile tool provides visual comparisons that will leave you stunned! (maybe)</p>

			<h1 class="title">Behind the Tool</h1>
			<p class="description">Check out the history of this tool and what has made it what it is!</p>
			<article id="information-section">
				<p>There have been so many times I've wanted to compare the size of one thing to the size of something else but there just weren't any comparison images anywhere to be found. Then, in July, 2023, I started work on the now quite popular YouTube video </p><a href="https://www.youtu.be/cJOHvciuHj8">When MASSIVE Becomes TINY</a><p> where I tried to put into perspective some of the sizes of our Universe. But, there's only so much you can fit in one video and there were still thousands of things with no way to compare their size. So, I started work on possibly my biggest project yet, this comparison tool! I set my goal for the first version to be released to the public when there were over 100 objects in the tool's database. It was a massive undertaking to create hundreds of graphics, and I wanted the tool's beta version to be public before my video was published! But, just a little less than a month later, the first version was released to the public.</p><br>
				<p>Since I wanted this tool to continue growing so that more and more objects could be compared, I made it possible for anyone to submit graphics for the tool. But the tool still had many hard edges and occasional glitches and, with the tool growing in popularity having over 300 daily comparisons, I knew something had to be done. So, in August, 2024, I began an entire rewrite and redesign of the tool. While trying to retain the good parts of the previous design, I added new features and polished up the overall design making the tool more visually appealing and user-friendly.</p>
