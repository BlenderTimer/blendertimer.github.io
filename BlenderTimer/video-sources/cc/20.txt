We generally think of water as
just...water and maybe a little
dirt and bacteria added in if
the water isn't clean. But there
is something absolutely incredible
in most water that is rarely seen
by the average person. Diatoms.
Diatoms are single celled organisms
which live in water. In fact,
they may even be in the water
you drink ! They come in some
of the most unnatural looking
shapes and designs you can find
in the natural world! Unlike snowflakes,
these aren't just inanimate crystals!
These are living organisms!
Of course, besides the living
ones, there are also trillions
upon trillions of dead ones as
they generally only live for a few days!
And the size of these incredible
constructions are generally only
about 2 to 200 micrometers, which
is about the thickness of a single
human hair!
So what is the purpose of these
living, microscopic mansions?
Well, diatoms are responsible
for creating up to 50% of the
oxygen produced on Earth each year!
Nearly double the amount of oxygen
produced by trees!
