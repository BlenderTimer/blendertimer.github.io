Have you ever used a question mark
and an exclamation mark together?
Well, believe it or not there's actually
a real punctuation mark
designed specifically for that purpose
called an Interrobang!
It's basically just an exclamation mark
and a question mark combined into one glyph.
It was invented in 1962 and
was meant to be used for
well not surprisingly
exclamatory questions such as
"What are you doing?" or
"Where is my car?"
