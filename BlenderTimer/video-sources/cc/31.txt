Did you know that the Earth is
upside-down? Earth has a north
pole and a south pole, just like
a giant magnet. Except...it's
not actually the way most people
think it is. What we call the
"North Pole" is actually the south
pole, and what we call the "South
Pole" is actually the north pole.
If you know anything about magnets
you'll know that the north pole
of a magnet will not face the
north pole of another magnet (at
least not without significant force).
This is why we call the Earth's
south pole the "North Pole". Because
the north pole of a compass faces
the south pole of the Earth. But
the "North Pole" is in fact Earth's
south pole.
But it'd be really confusing
if you started reversing the names
of the poles so it's probably
best to call the North and South
Pole by their normal but definitely
inaccurate names.
