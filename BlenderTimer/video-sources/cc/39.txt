You're currently living in your future.
At the same time, what you're
looking at right now is in the past.
In fact, the present doesn't even
really exist. Say the present
is right now. Well, in the amount
of time it took for me to say "now",
you to hear the sound waves from
me saying "now", and your brain
to process those sound waves into
the word "now" is a long time.
But you're living in your future
because you had a past, and in
your past you thought about your future.
You're now living in the future
you thought about. But what your
seeing is...well everything is
in both the future and the past.
Every action you make is in the
past, everything you see is in
the past, every thought you make
is in the past, but, compared
to your past and simply because
there was and still is a past,
it's all happening in the future.
How everything is happening in
the past and the future but the
present doesn't exist...I don't know.
