Your brain processes the equivalent
of around 1.6 megabytes per second.
That might not sound like much
until you realize that in just
one minute your brain will have
processed the equivalent of 96
million letters or about 300 books.
In one hour your brain will have
processed the equivalent of over
40 thousand webpages. And in a
day you'll have processed the
equivalent of 3 and a half days
of full HD video or 23 years of audio!
Oh and as a side note, around
3.8 terabytes of data is created
per second. But all humans on
the planet combined process the
equivalent of 12.8 thousand terabytes
per second.
