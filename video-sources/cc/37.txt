Triangles are incredible! Hexagons
are cool and all (and it's clear
I love them) but triangles are
arguably even more fascinating
and important. You see, triangles
are the only shape which cannot be bent.
It doesn't matter how much you
move the 3 points around, you
can never bend a triangle, only
rotate, scale, distort and otherwise
move it around. Lines and points
are the same, but they have no
surface area. The line is infinitely
thin and the point is infinitely small.
If you keep all sides of a triangle
the exact same length, the triangle
cannot be distorted at all. A
square can be deformed even if
all sides stay the same length.
Same with any other polygon, except
triangles. But hexagons still
look better.
