Did you know there's a punctuation
mark for irony? Actually, there
are several, or rather, there
were several proposed. Proposed
as far back as the 1580s and as
recently as 2007, the currently
recognized, yet largely forgotten,
irony mark is this one. It is
essentially a backwards question
mark and would be used for sarcastic
comments or rhetorical questions.
Unfortunately, as with the interrobang,
this symbol is almost entirely
forgotten in society. I'm not
sure why but it's probably because
keyboards are already overflowing
and can barely hold the symbols
they have already, and probably
just that people can usually tell
what is intended as sarcasm based
on context. Not to mention emojis
which are arguably better at portraying
irony then a punctuation mark
could ever be.
