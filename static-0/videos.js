		cc:"The National Science Foundation reported that in 2012 26% of Americans thought that the Sun orbited the Earth, rather than the Earth orbiting the Sun. While it's a slightly old statistic, the public's scientific knowledge has stayed almost the same for the past decade. So let's explore our Solar System and learn some interesting facts along the way!  Let's start with the Moon, our closest neighbour. The Moon has a diameter of 2159 miles at its equator. A little more than one quarter the diameter of Earth. The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. And even though it's our closest neighbour, it's still a long distance away. The Moon is an average of about 238,000 miles from Earth. To put that into perspective, all the planets in the Solar System can fit between the Earth and the Moon! Now since it has an elliptical orbit, the distance can vary about 26,000 miles. Which observed from Earth, makes the Moon appear different sizes depending on where it is in it's orbit. Another interesting fact about the moon is that it rotates at nearly the same rate that it orbits the Earth, so we only ever see one side of the moon.  The Sun is the largest, most massive object in our Solar System, with a diameter of over 864,000 miles and over 333,000 times the mass of Earth! Light can travel around the entire Earth in nearly one tenth of a second, but light would take nearly 15 seconds to travel around the Sun! Even though that sounds big, the Sun is actually just an average sized star. Other stars have been found that are over 1,700 times larger than the Sun! Because the Sun is the most massive, the Sun is the center of the Solar System, with all the planets and asteroids orbiting around it, hence the name \"Solar System\". The Sun is composed of hydrogen and helium, and is held together by its own gravitational pull. In the center of the Sun, where hydrogen is fused to form helium, the temperature exceeds 25 million degrees Fahrenheit!  Mercury is the first planet out from the Sun and has the fastest orbit velocity of all the planets, making one complete orbit about every 3 months. Mercury is also the smallest planet with a diameter of only 3032 miles, just 873 miles bigger than the Moon. And at 364 quintillion tons, Mercury is also the planet with the lowest mass. Mercury is the only other terrestrial planet, besides Earth, to have a global magnetic field. So you'd probably get lost on all the others.  Venus is a special planet for many reasons, one of which is that at 7521 miles, its diameter is just 405 miles smaller than Earth's! It's also the only planet that spins backwards… at least sort of. Technically Uranus spins backwards too, but… we'll get to that later. Another thing that makes Venus special is that it is the third brightest object in the sky, with only the Sun and Moon brighter than it! In fact, on a clear night with no ambient light, such as the Moon, Venus is actually bright enough to cast shadows! Even though Venus has a size similar to Earth, because it's closer to the Sun it has a faster orbit velocity than Earth. It's not quite as fast as Mercury, though. Instead, Venus takes a little over 7 months to orbit the Sun. Venus is also very warm with temperatures exceeding 850 degrees Fahrenheit! The hottest temperatures of all the planets! Even more special than Venus is Earth. Earth is the only planet designed to support life and do to the Earth's large amount of water, which covers over 70% of it's surface, the Earth has often been referred to as the Blue Marble. Earth is the largest of the four terrestrial planets with a diameter of 7926 miles, which, though it sounds big, is nearly invisible when compared to the Sun! Speaking of the Sun. Remember that light that could travel around the Sun in 15 seconds? Well, for it to travel from the Sun to Earth takes 8 minutes and 20 seconds! And here's an interesting fact, if sunlight takes 8 minutes and 20 seconds to reach Earth, every time you look at the Sun you are looking 8 minutes and 20 seconds back in time! Quite fascinating, though, I wouldn't recommend doing it for very long. Not surprisingly, Earth takes 365 days to orbit the Sun… at 66,600 miles per hour… that is one fast ride. As the third planet from the Sun, we are already 93 million miles away, and we still have 5 planets to go!  Mars is the last terrestrial planet and is also the second smallest planet with a diameter of only 4221 miles. But it's small size doesn't prevent it from having both the largest canyon and largest mountain in the entire Solar System! Valles Marineris, the largest canyon, is long enough to stretch across the entire Continental US and is nearly 4 times deeper than the Grand Canyon! Olympus Mons, the largest mountain, is three times taller than Mount Everest, and has a base as large as the state of Arizona! Mercury and Venus have no moons, but Mars has two. Mars is also the planet with the closest day length to Earth, taking just 42 minutes longer to make one rotation around its axis. It also has a fairly similar orbit velocity, though, the orbit velocity of Venus is technically closer to Earths orbit velocity. We're now transitioning from hot to cold. Mars has a average temperature of -85 degrees Fahrenheit. For comparison, the average on Earth is 59.  The Asteroid Belt is not a planet… but is instead a belt of asteroids, just in case that needed to be clarified. The Asteroid Belt contains millions of asteroids and is about 92 million miles thick. Even though there's millions upon millions of asteroids, because the belt is spread out through a large area of space if you were to stand on one asteroid the asteroid next to you would be so far away that it'd be barely visible. The belt is positioned about 230 million miles from the Sun, between the orbit of Mars and Jupiter.  We're now past the four terrestrial planets and on to the four gas planets, which or often referred to as the gas giants, because they are massive! The first in the lineup is Jupiter, the largest of all the planets in the Solar System with a diameter of 88,846 miles! Jupiter is so massive that in technicality, it doesn't actually orbit the Sun! Rather the Sun and Jupiter orbit a center point just above the surface of the Sun. Jupiter is more than double the mass of all the other planets in the Solar System combined! Jupiter is the fastest spinning planet making a full rotation in less than 10 hours. Although, it's not so fast orbiting the Sun, taking nearly 12 years to orbit the Sun. Jupiter is also very cold with a average temperature of -166 degrees Fahrenheit.  Saturn is the second largest planet in the Solar System with a diameter of 74,897 miles and, not surprisingly, is also the second most massive. Although Saturn is the second most massive planet it is also the planet with the lowest density. Saturn has such a low density that it could actually float, if you could find a container large enough to fit it in. Saturn is best known for its beautiful rings which are composed of objects ranging in size from a grain of sand to a entire mountain! But, even though there are huge objects in Saturn's rings, if the rings were scaled down to the diameter of Earth they would be thinner than a single sheet of paper! Besides its rings, Saturn also has an astounding 82 moons, which is the highest number of natural satellites of all the planets! Like Jupiter, Saturn is very cold with an average temperature of -220 degrees Fahrenheit! Saturn has been known for thousands of years making it the farthest planet from the Sun that was discovered without the use of a telescope.  With a diameter of 31,763 miles, Uranus is less than half the size of Saturn but is still 4 times larger than Earth. Uranus is also only about 15% the mass of Saturn but is still 15 times more massive than Earth. Unlike Saturn, which was discovered without the use of a telescope, Uranus was the first planet discovered with the aid of a telescope. It was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel, although he originally thought it was either a comet or a star. Uranus takes over 80 years to orbit the Sun! Although it doesn't orbit quite like all the other planets. While all the other planets orbit the Sun like a spinning top, Uranus rolls around the Sun like a ball. Since it orbits in this way, it actually spins clockwise, the same direction as Venus, which is opposite of all the other planets. The average temperature on Uranus is -320 degrees Fahrenheit! Although that's not why it's blue. Uranus is actually blue because Neptune is blue… Well, not really. But it is for the same reason. Because of all the methane gas in their atmosphere, most of the red light is absorbed causing the blue color. Speaking of Neptune…  At about 2.8 billion miles, Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun. At this amazing distance, Neptune takes over 160 years to orbit the Sun! Because it's so far from the Sun, broad daylight on Neptune would appear more like dim twilight to us. Noon on Earth is about 900 times brighter than noon on Neptune! At 30,775 miles in diameter, Neptune is the smallest gas planet but that doesn't make it docile. Neptune has the strongest winds in the Solar System, blowing at over 1,200 miles per hour! That's literally Mach 1.5! Faster than the speed of sound! The average temperature on Neptune is -330 degrees Fahrenheit, exactly 10 degrees colder than Uranus! Although that sounds cold, Triton, one of Neptune's moons, is one of the coldest objects in the Solar System with temperatures falling below -390 degrees Fahrenheit, that's colder than liquid nitrogen! Although Neptune is the farthest planet, there's still more to the Solar System, like the 5 dwarf planets which aren't classed with the others since they're too small to keep their orbit clear of other objects. But whatever the case, all these planets, dwarf planets, and asteroids, orbit the Sun creating our Solar System in the Milky Way galaxy.",

		cc:"The speed of light is exactly 670,616,629 miles per hour or 299,792,458 meters per second and is believed to be the fastest speed in the Universe. To put that into perspective, light can travel around the entire Earth over 7 times in just one second! But that's actually quite slow. It only appears fast to us since we're just a microscopic dot in an infinitely large Universe. Let's look at the speed of light from a much larger perspective, although first we need to understand a few things about light. Light was the first thing created in the Universe but what is light made of? Light is electromagnetic radiation. However, most people will connect the term light with visible light which is what your eyes are sensitive to, but visible light is only a very small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Besides visible light, the electromagnetic spectrum also includes Gamma Rays, X-Rays, Ultraviolet, Infrared, Microwaves, and Radio Waves. The wavelength of light is what determines it's category, or in the case of visible light, it's color. But what is electromagnetic radiation? Electromagnetic radiation, or light, is propagated by small particles known as Photons. Since light is actually a physical object, or more accurately, billions of tiny physical objects, light does actually apply force to any object it hits. However, since light is so, well...light, this doesn't have much of an effect on a large scale. So, no, you can't put a laser pointer under your car in place of a jack. Unlike other sections of the electromagnetic spectrum which are most often observed in black and white, visible light is observed in a whole variety of colors. The best demonstration of this is the rainbow. Although most people think there's 7 colors in the rainbow, there's actually much more. What we observe as colors are actually just different wavelengths of visible light. So red, is the longest visible wavelength and violet is the shortest visible wavelength. And, of course, there's more then just 7 wavelengths in between those two. The primary colors of light are often confused with the primary colors of ink. While the primary colors of ink are cyan, magenta, and yellow, the primary colors of light are red, green, and blue. In fact, magenta doesn't actually exist anywhere on the electromagnetic spectrum, magenta is actually a combination of the shortest and longest ends of the spectrum. While I could go on forever about what exactly light is and how it works, we should probably move on. How does the speed of light compare to the speed of sound? The best representation of just how much faster the speed of light is compared to the speed of sound is seen every time there's a thunderstorm. When you see a flash of lightning that's say 10 miles in the distance, you see it just 54 microseconds or 0.00005 seconds after it actually happened. Yet the thunder, or sound, takes over 47 seconds. That's nearly 1 million times slower than light! So if light is so much faster than sound, then how is the speed of light so slow? Well, because we've just been looking at what happens on our own tiny planet, there's still a whole Universe out there! And when the speed of light is compared to the whole Universe, it becomes a snails pace. Let's board a newly invented spacecraft that is capable of traveling at the speed of light. We'll call it the EMR-c, short for ElectroMagnetic Radiation and c which is commonly used to represent the speed of light. We'll start on Earth and begin exploring the rest of the Universe. We should probably do a quick flight around the Earth first, just to make sure all our systems are working correctly. Uh... That was pretty quick. About 0.134 seconds to make that flight. Anyway, it looks like the systems are working fine so let's head to the Sun next. It's our closest neighbouring star, so this shouldn't take very long. Ok, this is taking a while, let's fast forward a bit. And... We've arrived. According to our clock, that took a little under 8 minutes and 20 seconds. Let's zero out our stopwatch here, and compare everything to their distance from the Sun. Alright, let's head to the orbit of Neptune. We just went from the Earth to the Sun in a few minutes, so this shouldn't take too long. Let's fast forward a bit. Ok, I guess I was wrong again. It's already been an hour and we still haven't reached Neptune. I guess we'll have to fast forward even more. Well, that was the most boring ride of my life! Over 4 hours and we've finally reached the orbit of Neptune! Alright, let's head to Proxima Centauri, our second closest neighbouring star. It's quite a ways away, so it will take at least a few months to get there. Welp, it's been a year and we're still not there. I guess we'll have to fast forward even more! And, we've arrived. That took about 4 years and 3 months! I'm beginning to think this tour is gonna take a bit longer than expected. Let's take a trip to Sirius, the brightest star in the sky. Other then the Sun, that is. Well, here we are. Looks like that took us about 8 years and 8 months. Crazy that we were still traveling at the same speed that allowed us to fly around the Earth in less than one eighth of a second! Anyway, let's continue our journey. Looks like our next stop is Rigel. I think it's quite a ways away so let's switch to our engines that can propel us at 100 times the speed of light! I know we're going at 100 times the speed of light, but this seems like it's taking a very long time. I think we're going to have to fast forward quite a bit. Ok, that's Rigel. It took us 8 years and nearly 8 months to get here at 100 times the speed of light! The worst part is, we're not even close to the edge of our own galaxy! So, let's travel to the edge of our galaxy. Let's switch engines again. This time, we'll travel at 10 thousand times the speed of light! And here we are! The edge of the Milky Way galaxy! It took us 2 and a half years to travel here. And believe it or not, that was only about one quarter of the distance across the entire Milky Way! Alright, it's time we see just how slow the speed of light really is. This time, we're going to switch our engines to 1 billion times the speed of light, which is over 186 trillion miles per hour! Let's use this new speed to travel in a circle around the entire observable Universe. I hope you're ready for a very, very, long journey. It's now been a century! But we're not even half done, so... you might want to take up knitting or something. Alright! We've now finished our trip around the entire observable Universe. It's been nearly 300 years. Let's switch our clock back to light-years so we can better compare to traveling around the Earth. Wait?! What's that number? Oh, yeah, we were traveling at 1 billion times the speed of light. Remember how the speed of light when compared to the Universe becomes a snails pace? Well, a snail could travel around the entire orbit of Neptune over 3000 times before light could travel around the observable Universe, once! So, either the speed of light is extremely slow or the Universe is extremely large. In fact it could even be both.",

		cc:"Every physical object is made up of atoms. You, as a physical object, are made up of approximately 6.5 octillion atoms. But believe it or not, you're basically nothing. At an atomic scale you'd be completely invisible and because of that you wouldn't be able to collide with anything. You're probably really confused right now... Anyway, this is an atom. All atoms consist of protons, neutrons, and electrons. The protons and neutrons make up the nucleus and the electrons orbit around the nucleus, much like a solar system. This particular atom is a lithium atom. It's the one that you see everywhere. It has 3 electrons, 3 protons, and 3 neutrons. The amount of protons, neutrons, and electrons is what determines what type of material the atom is. This is the Periodic Table. This is where you have all your Dynamite, Pancakes, and Taxes. Each element has an atomic number which is this number here at the top. The atomic number refers to the number of protons and, for all neutral atoms, the number of electrons. The element with the lowest atomic number, or the fewest protons, is hydrogen which is the simplest of all elements. It has only 1 electron, 1 proton, and no neutrons. The element with the highest atomic number is Oganesson with approximately 118 protons, 118 electrons, and 184 neutrons. However, each element has isotopes. Isotopes are basically the family of the element. So for example, hydrogen has has three \"members\" in it's family. Protium, Deuterium, and Tritium. The Protium isotope is what you saw earlier, it has one proton and one electron. It is stable and is the most common of the three isotopes making up 99.985% of all naturally occurring hydrogen atoms. Deuterium, on the other hand, has a neutron and proton but, though it's stable, it only makes up about 0.0156% of all naturally occurring hydrogen. Tritium has two neutrons, and, unlike the other two isotopes, is not stable with a half-life of less than 13 years. Also, to be clear, a half-life is how long it takes for an atom to turn into a different element or isotope. So it's basically the lifetime of that specific isotope or element, it's not exactly the lifetime of the atom in general. Another thing to note about atoms is that they are extremely small. Which you probably knew. You could fit over 50 million atoms in just one inch! However, it's important to note that not all atoms are the same size. Helium, the smallest and funniest atom, is about 62 picometers in diameter, while the largest atom, Caesium, is about 265 picometers in diameter. So you could actually fit anywhere from 47 million to 400 million atoms in an inch. Atoms are mostly nothing. Even though they're often displayed like this, they're designed just like a solar system. If you scaled each proton, neutron, and electron down to it's actual size you wouldn't be able to see any of it! This is why you'd be invisible at an atomic scale. In fact, if you could remove all the empty space in the atoms that make up every person on the planet, you could fit everyone into a sugar cube! This also raises an important question, \"If there's so much empty space, what holds the atom together?\" The atom is held together by four forces, electromagnetic force, strong nuclear force, weak nuclear force, and gravity.  The electromagnetic force is what keeps the electrons in orbit around the nucleus. This is because the electron is negatively charged while the protons are positively charged. And the neutrons just sit there since they are neutral. Probably why they're called neutrons. Anyway, the strong nuclear force is what holds the protons and neutrons together creating the nucleus. The weak nuclear force controls how the atom decays. And of course gravity just pulls everything together. What is most surprising about all this is that since atoms are mostly just empty space, held together by invisible forces, it's not the atoms that collide but actually the invisible forces around them. Thus one surface never actually comes into contact with another. They are always separated by a small space. This is the exact reason why you can't touch anything. It might look like you're touching something, in fact it probably feels like you're touching something, but you never actually come into contact with the surface. All you're feeling is just the repelling forces, not the actual atoms themselves. And if you could remove the invisible forces you'd be able to walk right through a wall like it wasn't even there, because there's nothing to collide with. The chance of two atoms hitting each other would be very slim. Of course if you changed your definition of touch...",

		url:"4-what-you-didnt-know-about-roman-numerals",
		cc:"Around 1200 AD, Hindu numerals were introduced into Europe. At which point they began to be referred to as Arabic numerals and began increasing in popularity. Through the years, Arabic numerals have spread across the entire globe and, since the 15th century, have become the most commonly used numeral system in the world. However, previous to it's introduction in Europe, the Arabic numeral system could only be found in a few locations and was referred to as the Hindu numeral system. At that time there were wasn't a very universal numeral system but in Europe the most commonly used numeral system was the Roman numeral system. Which, as the name suggests was invented in Rome. They were created around the time Queen Esther was born. About 500 B.C. The modern Roman numeral system we use today is composed primarily of 7 letters. I, V, X, L, C, D, and M. I is equal to 1,  V is equal to 5, X is equal to 10, L is equal to 50, C is equal to 100, D is equal to 500, and M is equal to 1000. If you're like me and have trouble remembering what each of the numerals represents, just remember that I looks like a 1, V is five which is evenly divisible (wait no it's not), X kinda like two V's put together(ish), L is for “Lost in Roman numerals 50 times”, C is for century (which is 100 years), D is for “Didn't remember 500 was a D”, and M is for millennium (which is 1000 years). If you still can't remember them than maybe this will make it a little worse. If you need to write a number that's not one of the primary letters, like for example 149, you add larger numbers onto the end and subtract smaller numbers from the beginning. So 149 in Roman numerals would be CXLIX. Which reads out as 100+(50-10)+(10-1). X is a smaller number than L so it subtracts 10 from 50 leaving 40. I is smaller than X so it subtracts 1 from 10 leaving 9. Both combined equals 49 and adding the C gives us 149. There is a major problem with this system though. Actually, there's far more than one. First, there's not actually one way to write numbers. 999 for example can be written as CMXCIX, LMVLIV, VMIV, or simply IM. All of which equal 999 but are completely different. There are also some other ancient examples which are even more odd. Like 1613 being written as XVIXIII which literally means 16, 13 but it really makes no sense unlike the standard form which is MDCXIII. Another issue is that Roman numerals take up a lot of space. While 1000 is just a simple M, as soon as you go down one digit to 999 you suddenly have CMXCIX which is far longer than M. And while 1000 is M, 3888 is MMMDCCCLXXXVIII. In Arabic numerals those two numbers are the exact same length, but in Roman numerals one is 15 times longer than the other. Sometimes you can avoid this, like with 3999 for example. You could either write MMMCMXCIX which is the standard way, or you could write MMMIM which is not standard but is totally legal and much shorter. Yet another issue with Roman numerals is that there is no zero. Instead, if you needed a zero, you had to use the Latin word nulla. Eventually, someone decided Roman numerals needed a numeral for zero and decided to use N in the place of zero. This was to represent the “n” at the beginning of nulla. However, the N was never really standardized into Roman numerals possibly because N was also occasionally used to represent 90. Despite all these issues however, there are features in Roman numerals that you probably didn't know. For example, fractions. If you wanted to write ½ in Roman numerals, you'd simply have to write an S. Although, S technically isn't ½ but is instead 6/12. This is because when keeping the same base number it's much easier to handle fractions, such as ? and ¼, with 12 instead of 10. While one third of 12 is simply 4, one third of 10 is 3 point… yeah never mind. While S is the base fraction, fractions below ½ or 6/12 were still used. Any common fractions below ½ were dots. So 1/12 was one dot, 2/12 was two dots, 3/12 was 3 dots, 4/12 was 4 dots, and 5/12 was 5 dots. Then beyond was of course 6/12 as S, 7/12 as S dot, 8/12 as S two dots, 9/12 as S three dots, 10/12 as S four dots, 11/12 as S five dots, and 12/12 as I, because of course 12/12 is just 1. These fractions can also be combined with other numbers. So for example, 4½ would be written as IVS. There are also some other extensions to Roman numerals. The most popular being vinculum. Vinculum allows for much larger numbers than standard Roman numerals. For example the only way to write 10 thousand in standard Roman numerals would be MMMMMMMMMM. But this is obviously not very ideal as it's very long and quite confusing. Using vinculum however, you can write 10 thousand as X with a horizontal line over it which multiplies X by 1000. Or you could write it as M between two vertical lines which multiplies M by 10. Both are equal to 10 thousand and both have been used. Vinculum is the most commonly used extension today but there is one more that was previously very popular. Apostrophus was also used quite often. If you were to write 10 thousand using apostrophus, you'd simply have to write two sets of two C's, one being mirrored, with an I in between them. Each additional set of C's raises the value by a factor of 10. Though no one ever really wrote anything above 100,000. It was also possible to write numbers such as 5000 by using I and two backwards C's. 500 was just one backwards C, which is most likely where we get the modern D in standard Roman numerals. There were also some variations of this which linked the C's and I together like this. Although Arabic numerals have become the worldwide standard, Roman numerals are still used quite often, like as a more interesting way of displaying a number such as the current year, or as an additional numbered indention in a list. But for everyday use and mathematics, Arabic numerals are far superior.",

		cc:"Water is the most abundant molecule on Earth. So abundant, in fact, that if Earth lost 10 trillion drops of water every second, it would take over 80 thousand years for Earth to lose all of its water! Of course this isn't too surprising since Earth's water weighs over 1.5 quintillion tons. Which believe it or not is only about 0.0002% of all Earth's mass! Although every cloud in the sky weighs around 1 million tons. So they're not actually light and fluffy at all, they are uh... heavy and fluffy... which doesn't make any sense... Anyway, water is the only substance on Earth that can be naturally found in three forms. The three forms being liquid, solid, and gas. When it's in it's liquid form it's typically referred to as water... you didn't know that... right? In it's solid form it's typically referred to as ice... that was news to absolutely no one. And in it's gaseous form it's typically referred to as water vapor or [*clears throat] steam. Of course it's gas form has nothing to do with gasoline. Don't get those two confused or you'll end up with a worse situation then that time you tried to use a laser pointer as a jack. Oh and remember how there's like some 1.5 quintillion tons of water on Earth? Well, most of that water is actually salt water. 97.5% to be not exact, but as close to exact as science can figure. If you want some fresh water you've got to head over to Antarctica. Where some 70% of our fresh water is. Now, don't get confused, there's not like a giant fresh water lake in Antarctica. Oh no, it's far to cold for that, all that fresh water is located in the 7.2 million cubic miles of ice there. Most of Earth's fresh water is frozen. 30% of the Earth's fresh water is located in the ground, in the form of... you guessed it... groundwater. Oh, and we can't forget the billions of lakes and rivers that make up a whole uh... 0.1% of the Earth's water. And rather shockingly, this nearly invisible and tasteless liquid, can dissolve more substances than any other liquid on the planet. It can even dissolve metals! Hence why it's often referred to as the Universal Solvent. Of course, it can't dissolve everything. I mean if you put some oil in water you'll find that out pretty quickly. Now while it can dissolve metal, it's important to note that most metals will only dissolve slightly in water. This is because after some time there is a coating formed around the metal known as rust. And, of course, rust largely protects the inner metal from the water.  When referring to water here we're referring to pure water. Pure water, is simply H2O. Which, by the way, does not mean that it converts hamsters to ostriches. It simply means that there are 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom in 1 water molecule. There are about 1.5 sextillion water molecules in one drop of water. Which means there's about 7 septillion molecules in 1 glass of water, about 3 undecillion molecules in a lake, and about 5 octodecillion molecules on Earth. Don't worry about remembering those numbers though, just remember that pure water has a pH of around 7. For comparison lemon juice as a pH of around 2 and soap has a pH of around 10. The pH of course representing \"potential hydrogen\" which probably didn't help any. Just know that pH represents the acidity of the substance. The lower the pH the higher the acidity and the higher the pH the lower the acidity. 0 being the lowest pH and 14 being the highest pH. When frozen, water expands by about 9%. Actually, that's a very pathetically simple way of putting it but we'll get to that a bit later. When water expands it can create enormous pressure. So much pressure, in fact, that if you filled an iron sphere with water and then froze it, the water would expand and the iron sphere would explode! That is quite some energy! Anyway, back to the pathetically simple 9% expansion statement. Most liquids, such as paraffin wax and oil, get more dense when cooled. And water, as a liquid, also get's more dense as it cools. You're probably now confused as to why it expands but it also shrinks. This is because water shrinks in volume until about 40�F. Then the water suddenly stops condensing (or shrinking) and begins expanding. As it expands it of course get's less dense. This is the reason why ice floats on the surface. And because it floats on the surface, it keeps much of the water underneath from further freezing. Water is the only liquid on the entire planet that expands when frozen. And if it weren't for this amazing singularity in it's design, ice would simply sink and more ice would form on the surface. This would continue until all the streams, ponds, lakes, rivers, and even the ocean were completely frozen and the Earth would become a massive ball of ice.",

		cc:"What would an ideal language sound like? Or, what would it look like? If you were biased, you might think that English is the most superior, or that Spanish is the most superior, or that some other language is the most superior. But if you think about it for even just a few seconds, you'll realize how pathetic all of these languages are. I mean English, the worst of them all, has words such as \"analysis\". Which, by the way, is 100% Latin. It's not even English. Same with \"pure\" which is 100% French, \"trade\" which is 100% German, \"simple\" which is also 100% French, \"area\" which is 100% Latin, \"index\" which is 100% Latin, and basically half the other \"English\" words. And I mean, this is a horn. This is also a horn. And this is red. This is also read. Or you could read it. Both are spelled exactly the same but sound different, depending on the mood your in. I guess... And of course, this is dessert. And this is deserted. And this is the desert. And of course you deserve this because it's your desert. So just don't desert the deserted desert of your desert or you'll desert the dessert you had that was your desert in the deserted desert. [CUT] Anyway, the point is, English is completely out of the question because it's basically just all the other languages combined into one rubbish pile. But maybe there's another language that's better. I mean it's quite possible that somewhere there's a language that's far superior to anything we've ever seen. Although... I don't think we're going to find it amongst humans. You see, humans have changed their languages millions of times throughout history. Which can only mean two things. One, we still don't have a perfect language. Or two, we're just really stupid. You would think that, as the same species, humans would all speak the same language. But currently, there's over 7000 languages spoken amongst humans. Oh, and, believe it or not, as incompetent as English is, it's still the language with the most speakers. Now before you go clacking away about how Chinese has the most speakers, note that English has the most speakers overall, but Chinese (specifically Mandarin) has the most \"native\" speakers. In fact English has nearly twice as many non-native speakers as as it does native speakers. While Mandarin has over 4.6 times more native speakers than non-native speakers.  Actually, I guess binary has the most speakers. I mean, there's over 30 billion electronic devices on Earth, all of which speak binary so... Anyway, in total English has over 1.1 billion speakers. That are all \"Made in China\". Oh wait, wrong speakers. I told you English was confusing. Especially since there's like tons of words that have other words that look and/or sound almost identical to each other. Kinda like though, through, thorough, tough, trough, thought. Like was English just made to be confusing? Ok. We could try to create a superior language in a simple yet fully capable way, a great example being Morse Code. Morse Code is superior in some ways to English, mainly in the fact that because it's so simple, you can speak it with lights, horns (not that kind), electric pulses, dots and dashes, and pretty much anything else. But where it lacks is in the fact that it takes ages just to communicate one word. I mean, just communicating one letter can take anywhere from 30 milliseconds to 2 seconds! [code audio] And if you want to communicate even a very short word like \"help!\", it's going to take you anywhere from 6 to 8 seconds! [code audio] If you want to communicate a sentence such as \"The current condition is hazardous.\" it could take up to a minute! I guess if you were really great at thinking at the speed of light you could transmit the information in lightning fast way. [code audio] Most computers would be able to interpret that but for a human... that's going to be impossible. Although, despite all the issues with Morse Code, it does sound kinda interesting, you got to admit. Maybe instead of looking at languages invented by humans though, we should search for the perfect language in the animal kingdom. I mean you can already find many similar languages to Morse Code amongst many marine animals and insects such as crickets. In fact I discovered by accident that crickets have some sort of code they use for communication that's nearly identical to Morse Code. Take a listen to this sound captured just few inches from the cricket. [cricket audio] If you listen to this much slower and analyze the audio's spectrogram, you'll see that each singular trill of the cricket is multiple smaller pulses. [audio slower] Each pulse appears to be the same pitch but there's distinctly a code there. And just like Morse Code, it's composed of long and short pulses. I don't know what the code is or how to translate it, but I do find it quite fascinating! In fact, I wrote down the code of the full 2 minute clip. Not that it was of any use. I'll leave links in the description for the spreadsheet and the full 2 minute audio clip, just in case anyone is interested in analyzing it more thoroughly. The issue with all these Morse Code type languages though, is that they're not very elegant. They sound interesting, sure, but they don't have the nice flow some other languages have. Birds, for example, have some of the most elegant language on the planet. [goose] Well... songbirds at least. I mean, the Pacific Wren was designed with the most stunning song I've ever heard. [song audio] Sounds great, right? In those 9 seconds, it's possible the bird could have said the equivalent of over 50 English words. In fact, as it turns out, if you play this song at one quarter it's original speed, you won't hear a bird song at all, but instead a full orchestra. [song at 0.25x speed] Doesn't it just sound like an entire paragraph? Perhaps it's just me, but I find these different languages fascinating! The fact that all these languages sound completely different but are all still very interesting in their own way. And sometimes you almost feel like you can understand them. Which of these languages was your favorite? Please don't tell me it was English.",

		cc:"Did you know that Antarctica's 7.2 million cubic miles of ice holds 70 percent of our fresh water? Here are 15 other facts that are nearly impossible to believe. We generally think of space as being really far away, but in reality, it's not actually that far. The generally accepted altitude of space, or rather, the imaginary line where space begins, is the Kármán line. The Kármán line is of course not a physical object, but instead just an altitude where an imaginary line sits that we defined as the border between space and not space. It sits at 100 kilometers or 62.1 miles above sea level. That might sound like a long way but, if you could drive on a vertical highway, it would only take about an hour to reach the Kármán line. For comparison, if you instead wanted to plan your road trip all the way to the Moon, it would take over 4 and a half months. Yeah, space really isn't that far away. The biggest issue, really, is just driving straight up. Although, what's not an issue is falling straight down. Unless of course you're standing on the ground in which case you can't really fall anywhere. Except to the ground I guess. And, while it takes about an hour to reach space, if you fell in a hole that went straight to the center of the Earth it would take over 19 minutes to reach the bottom of that hole (or the center of the Earth). That's long enough for light to travel to the moon and back over 445 times! Although, if you counted air resistance into that, it'd actually take more like 33 hours. Most of that time you'd be traveling around 120mph! That's the speed of a small plane! Something that's even faster than that, though, are tsunamis! Tsunamis can travel at speeds nearly 600 miles per hour! That's faster than most airliners! At that speed, a tsunami could travel across the entire Pacific Ocean in less than 13 hours! Of course, this is the speed of the waves out in the middle of the ocean. Near the shore, the speed decreases and the height increases. This is what causes waves to break. In fact, out in the middle of the ocean, the tsunamis can be over 300 miles long. While most tsunamis are only a few feet in height, tsunamis can occasionally reach heights of over 1700 feet which is taller than the Empire State Building! Oh, and even though a tsunami can travel across the Pacific Ocean in just 13 hours, the Pacific Ocean is actually larger than all the land masses on Earth combined! In fact, the Pacific Ocean covers about 30 percent of the Earth's surface! And combining all the rivers, lakes, and oceans together, around 71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered with water! Perhaps the reason why we've only explored about 5 percent of our oceans. In fact, around 2000 new marine species are discovered every year! Compared to mammals which we only discover about 50 new species every year. With all this water covering most of the Earth's surface, it's no wonder the Earth was nicknamed the “Blue Marble”. Speaking of the Pacific Ocean, in the western Pacific Ocean, near the Mariana Islands, lies the Mariana Trench, which you might know is the deepest place in the ocean. The deepest portion of the Mariana Trench has been named “Challenger Deep”, and for good reason. You see, down at a depth of over 36,000 feet, you have that much water stacked on top of you. And because of this, the pressure at that depth is nearly 8 tons per square inch which is the equivalent of having 3 SUVs sitting on just one square inch! That's enough pressure to break aluminum and puncture 12 gauge steel! This is why only 22 missions have been made to those incredible depths. Compared to the nearly 7000 missions made to the top of Mt. Everest! Any submarines that travel to the insane depths of Challenger Deep have to be specially designed to not break under nearly 7 miles of water! That's well over a mile deeper than Mt. Everest is tall! In fact, submarines can shrink by about 2 and a half inches from the immense pressure at those depths. Rather surprisingly though, the temperature at this depth is generally only about 35 degrees Fahrenheit which really isn't that cold for being so far from sunlight. I mean, it can't get too cold anyway, though, because, believe it or not, there is a limit to how cold anything can get. The minimum temperature being -459.67 degrees Fahrenheit. The reason nothing can get colder than this temperature, is because heat is produced by particles (like atoms and molecules) jostling around, so the minimum temperature is when the these particles are perfectly still. This temperature, of course, being -459.67 degrees Fahrenheit, which is exactly 0 degrees Kelvin. Speaking of zero, if you've ever tried to divide a number by 0 on a calculator, you might have gotten a “divide by zero error”. This is because division is the exact opposite of multiplication. And anything multiplied by 0 is 0. So the question arises, what is something divided by 0. Well, if you divide anything by a number between 1 and 0, the number actually grows. This is the exact opposite of multiplication where anything multiplied by a number between 1 and 0 shrinks. What's interesting is that the size of the resulting number increases as the dividing number decreases. Until you of course get to 0 at which point the resulting number is unknown. Well, kinda. I mean, it's clearly infinity. Although, infinity certainly isn't a number. If you think about it, this does actually make sense. I mean, if division is the opposite of multiplication and anything multiplied by 0 is infinitely small, which is what 0 is, than anything divided by 0 should be infinitely large. Something that's also large, although not infinitely large, of course, are blue whales. Blue whales have a heart that beats only once every 10 seconds and weighs nearly a ton! In fact, the heart beat is so loud that it can be heard up to 2 miles away! Is that why blue whales don't have stethoscopes? Although, combined with all the various noises in the ocean and the fact that humans ears simply don't work well underwater, you probably wouldn't be able to hear it yourself. But if the ocean was completely silent and you had hydrophones for ears, you most certainly could. I think marine animals are some of the most amazingly designed creatures! And yet another amazingly designed marine animal, are dolphins. Dolphins are very special for many reasons. The most notable being that they are the second most intelligent animal on the Earth, second of course to humans. Although, if you ask me, they're probably actually smarter, we just won't admit it. I mean, dolphins have even guided ships through dangerous waters. When was the last time you had to guide a dolphin? In fact, dolphins are so intelligent that they even call each other by name! Not in English of course, but in specific whistles. Dolphins also only sleep one half at a time. So while one eye is closed, the other eye is open. While one half of the brain is sleeping, the other is wide awake. This is to protect themselves from danger. How many humans do you know that sleep while watching for danger? Dolphins can also tell the difference between metals while blindfolded! This is of course possible because of their amazingly designed sonar, or echolocation, but it's still yet another thing where dolphins exceed the capability of humans. I think dolphins are definitely smarter than humans. Although...I guess, I might just be biased because... dolphins are rather cute... and humans really aren't doing a good job of proving their intelligence. And speaking of intelligence, dogs are one of the most intelligent creatures. They're not quite as intelligent as dolphins though, but one way they exceed humans is of course in their sense of smell. A dog's sense of smell is so good that it can detect a teaspoon of sugar in a million gallons of water! To put that into perspective, a million gallons of water is the size of the average pond! Even though humans aren't as smart as they claim to be, we still have an amazing design. A great example of this being our efficiency. Not how good we are at getting work done, I mean there's few humans that are good at that, but instead how efficient our body is. Your brain, for example, can store about 2.5 million gigabytes of data! The resolution of the human eye is about 576 megapixels, and we can detect up to 150 frames per second. The average pixel uses about 3 bytes of space. So just in vision alone the human brain can process the equivalent of 260 gigabytes per second. That's about the speed of the average computer! And to do all this incredible work, our brain only uses about 12 watts of power! For comparison, the average laptop uses about 50 watts of power. The average desktop computer can use up to 500 watts of power! And the most powerful computers on Earth (known as supercomputers) use up to 10 million watts of power! Yeah, the human brain is rather efficient! Speaking of efficiency, swifts, a type of bird, can stay airborne for up to 10 months! They have this ability because they of course eat insects, most of which are in the air. Swifts also have this ability since they can sleep while flying. I'm beginning to think that all our computers, airplanes, and other inventions, aren't actually as great as we thought they were. Anyway, there are 206 bones in the human body. And what's so amazing about this, is that a quarter of these bones ...are in your feet. That's 26 bones per foot! Although, over a quarter of your bones are in your hands. That means over 51 percent of your bones are in your hands and feet. That's quite a bit when your hands and feet are only about 2.3 percent the volume of your entire body. Oh and remember how dolphins sleep one half at a time? Well snails aren't quite so good. In fact, a snail can sleep for up to 3 years! Snails only live for 3 to 15 years! So 3 years would be a large portion of their lifetime! You know something else that is related to lifetime? Language. Most likely, you've spoken at least one language for most of your life. And that language probably still exists today. But, believe it or not, every 40 days, another language or dialect goes extinct. That's 9 languages per year! That means in just 10 years, over 1 percent of the current languages will be extinct. Hey I did it! I got a Gen-Z to watch 10 minutes of science!",

		cc:"On January 15, 1919 one of the strangest and most absurd events occurred. What would later become known as The Great Molasses Flood took place in the North End neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. As absurd as it may sound, this was in fact a real world, historical event and the story goes something like this. January of 1919 was just like any other winter. On January 12, it was cold with a temperature of around 2 degrees Fahrenheit. However, on the 13th the temperature began to rise. On the 15th the temperature had risen to about 41 degrees Fahrenheit, which was not too out of the ordinary and was certainly a nice improvement over the frigid temperatures of the previous days. The 15th started out just like any other day would. To most everyone at the time, it was just another Wednesday. But, of course, all tragedies and life changing events happen on seemingly ordinary days. At around 12:41 PM the residents of North End, Boston heard a loud rumble similar to that of a passing train. There was an elevated railway that ran through that area, so this was nothing out of the ordinary. That was, of course, until it was out of the ordinary. The sound quickly became much louder than that of a passing train and just a split second after the sound was heard, a 40 foot wave of some dark, viscous liquid, flew through the neighbourhood at over 30 miles an hour. And of course with the high viscosity the wave was also very sticky. This, however, did not slow the wave down, it continued to fly through the neighbourhood at incredible speeds. There was no time to escape the wave, or even comprehend what was happening. Anyone in the path of the wave, was swept away, along with all the houses, cars, animals, and pretty much everything else. Many people were smashed into nearby walls and many were swept into the nearby harbor. This wave was not at all water, but instead a dark, sticky, viscous liquid, known as molasses. It might not sound like this wave would be that much worse than water (other than the cleanup, of course) but a wave of molasses is actually far worse than a wave of water. You see, molasses is around 60% more dense than the design water, so a wave of molasses does far more damage than a wave of water. Not to mention the fact that the molasses made rescue operations nearly impossible. The Boston Post reported: \"Molasses, waist deep, covered the street and swirled and bubbled about the wreckage... Here and there struggled a form—whether it was animal or human being was impossible to tell. Only an upheaval, a thrashing about in the sticky mass, showed where any life was... Horses died like so many flies on sticky fly-paper. The more they struggled, the deeper in the mess they were ensnared. Human beings —men and women—suffered likewise.\" And of course, it was not only persons caught in the initial wave who where struggling, but also the rescuers. The first rescuers to the scene were 116 cadets under the direction of Lieutenant Commander H. J. Copeland from the nearby Massachusetts Nautical School. Shortly after, personnel from the Boston Police, Army, Navy, and Red Cross arrived on the scene. The conditions were not at all optimal and to make them yet worse, the molasses began to cool, and thickened even more than it was before. The increasing viscosity made it harder and yet harder for those trying to escape the mess, and for the rescuers trying to traverse through it. Many of the rescuers worked through the night to find and tend to the dozens of injured people and their fellow exhausted rescuers. It was so hard to find people in the mess that it took 4 days before rescue operations ended. Although, many of the dead had been swept out into the harbor where they were not found until months after the event. In total, around 150 people were injured, and 21 died. At this point you're probably wondering where so much molasses could come from. Well, it all came from a large storage tank near the harbor. Molasses was unloaded from ships, put in the storage tank, and later transferred via pipeline to the Purity ethanol plant in Cambridge. During January 12 and 13, just a couple days before the disaster, a ship had unloaded it's supply of molasses into the tank. Since the temperatures were rather cold, the molasses was heated to lower it's viscosity for the transfer. On the 13th, just shortly after the transfer was complete, many workers heard the sound of bubbling inside the tank. It was later reported: \"The warm molasses... was mixing with the cold, thick molasses that had been congealing inside the tank for weeks, producing a bubbling churn that vibrated against the tank's walls. The men on the Commercial Street wharf heard those walls groaning, [like they] had heard them groan many times before, usually immediately after a delivery, but it is unlikely that they knew that when warm and cold molasses mix, the reaction triggers a fermentation process that produces gas. And in a near-full tank, that gas increases the pressure against the steel walls.\" Not only was the molasses fermenting and increasing pressure, but with the new delivery of molasses, the tank was nearly at it's maximum capacity \"with 2.3 million gallons of molasses that reached a height of forty-eight feet, nine inches, and weighed 26 million pounds.\" This is very likely the reason why the tank burst. Although, it was also found that the tank had not been built properly and even before the disaster, it leaked molasses. In fact, it leaked so bad that the tank was painted brown to hide the leakage. After the disaster, the Purity Distilling Company eventually was forced to pay for damages estimated at around $628,000 (which would be equivalent to nearly $11 million today). Not surprisingly, the mess was a nightmare to clean up. Cleanup crews, which of consisted of hundreds people, used various methods including spraying seawater from a fireboat to wash away the molasses and also using sand to absorb it. But even with so many people, it took months to clean the area. Rescuers, cleanup crews, and sight-seers had tracked the molasses everywhere. It was even reported that: \"Everything a Bostonian touched was sticky.\" Even decades after the disaster, residents reported that the area still smelled like molasses on hot summer days. This disaster is certainly one of the most absurd tragedies, that has ever occurred!",

It is the tallest land animal on the planet. Not the biggest, but the tallest. This is the Space Shuttle. It served for 30 years as one of the main transportation vehicles between Earth and space, but was eventually retired in 2011. It is absolutely massive, coming in at 184 feet tall and weighing over 2000 tons! It's actually pretty small though. Remember, we are going BIG. This is the Saturn V...more commonly known as the Saturn 5. At 363 feet, it is nearly double the height of the Space Shuttle. But, it's still really, really, REALLY tiny! This is Hyperion. At over 380 feet, Hyperion is the tallest tree in the world. It's trunk is a remarkable 16 feet in diameter! This is the Eiffel Tower. It comes in at 1083 feet. Nearly 3 times as tall as the Saturn V! This is the Burj Khalifa. Completed in January of 2010, it is currently the tallest building in the world. At 2,722 feet, it is over half a mile tall. But it too is absolutely minute. This is Mount Saint Helens. Coming in at just over 8,360 feet, Mount Saint Helens is not actually one of the tallest mountains in the world. Which immediately makes it sound much less impressive. But it's actually massive...but also very, very tiny. This is Currant Peak. It's 11,518 feet in height, a little over 2 miles. This is Mount Rainier. At 14,410 feet, it is... not actually very big. Remember, we've still got a ways to go. I mean, we're still on Earth. Although, we will only be for a short while longer. This is Denali. Even though it is the third highest of the Seven Summits, it's only the 245th tallest mountain in the world. But at a magnificent 20,310 feet, it is 3,500 times taller than the average human. But don't forget, it's still tiny. This is Mt. Everest. At 29,032 feet, Mt. Everest is not only the tallest mountain but also the tallest object above sea level on Earth. So, enjoy Earth while you can, because this will be the last time you see Earth. Anyway... This is Halley's Comment. No...comet. I can never pronounce that right. At 9.3 miles on it's longest axis...it's uh... not actually that much larger than Mt. Everest. But it's still massive... and also very, very, VERY tiny. This is Bernardinelli-Bernstein. The largest comet ever discovered. But even at nearly 74 miles, it's not even as large as the smallest dwarf planet in our Solar System. Speaking of which... This is Hygiea. At nearly 270 miles, Hygiea is the smallest planet in our Solar System. It's of course not a regular planet, but instead a dwarf planet and was only just recently actually considered to be a dwarf planet. This is Ceres. Located in the asteroid belt, along with Hygiea, Ceres is over 587 miles in diameter! But it's not the biggest dwarf planet. This is good ol' Pluto. At 1,473 miles in diameter, Pluto is the largest of all the dwarf planets. This is the moon. Or maybe I should say, the Earth's moon. At 2,159.2 miles in diameter, the moon is not even double the size of Pluto. This is Mercury, the smallest of all the major planets. At over 3,000 miles in diameter, Mercury is just barely over twice the size of Pluto. Pluto is definitely quite big. This is Mars, the second smallest of all the major planets. Mars is only 4,208 miles in diameter, making it just a little bit larger than Mercury. This is Venus. Coming in at over 7,500 miles, Venus is just a little less than twice the size of Mars. This is Earth. This is a very special planet. Designed with life. Designed with water. Designed at just 7,913.162 miles in diameter, Earth is the fourth smallest planet in the Solar System. And if Pluto were a planet, Earth would be the fifth smallest and and fifth largest. But anyway... enjoy Earth while you can, because this will be the last time you see it. Wait, didn't I already say that? This is Neptune. At over 30,500 miles in diameter, Neptune is the smallest gas planet but the fourth largest planet. And also, the coldest, being the farthest major planet from the Sun. This is Uranus. Closer to the Sun than Neptune, but also larger at 31,399 miles in diameter. This is Saturn. Coming in at 71,229 miles in diameter, Saturn is the second largest planet and also has some beautiful rings. But no, we're measuring the planet itself, not the rings. This is Jupiter, the largest of all the planets in the Solar System with a diameter of 85,964 miles. But there's something in the Solar System that is still much bigger. This is the Sun. At 864,938 miles in diameter, the Sun is the largest object in the Solar System, and is over 10 times larger than Jupiter. The Sun is so massive that it makes up 99.86% of the mass of our entire Solar System! For comparison, Jupiter (which is more than double the mass of all the other planets combined) makes up less than 0.1% (0.095%) of the Solar System's mass. But don't worry. This gigantic star will very, very quickly become completely, invisibly small. This is Sirius A. No, seriously, it's Sirius. At nearly 1.47 million miles in diameter, Sirius is seriously massive. But not too massive. We've still got 10 more celestial creations to compare, and the transitions between them are rather extreme. This is Polaris, also known as the North Star since it's bright and fairly close to exactly north. At nearly 32.5 million miles in diameter, Polaris is over 37 times larger than our Sun. But it's actually still a pretty small star. This is VY Canis Majoris. And no, this is not the largest star. At only 1.2 billion miles in diameter, VY Canis Majoris is outranked by at least 6 other known stars. This is UY Scuti. While also previously the largest star, at a mere 1.48 billion miles in diameter, it is also now outranked by an even bigger star. This is Stephenson 2-18. Coming in at 1.86 billion miles in diameter, this is the current record holder for the largest known star. Now...prepare yourself for a massive jump in sizes. Because, though this star is massive, there are still things far more massive. And this star, is actually very, very small. This is Segue 2, one of the smallest galaxies in the Universe. And that...was not a good segue in comparisons. Anyway, though it's one of the smallest, it is still over 651 trillion miles in diameter! This is the Milky Way. At over 621 quadrillion miles in diameter, our galaxy is actually still a pretty small one. This is ESO 306-17. With a very unmemorable name, this galaxy is 1 million light-years in diameter or nearly 6 quintillion miles. But...our comparison will still get much, much larger. This is Alcyoneus, the largest galaxy we've ever discovered. At an astounding 16.3 million light-years in diameter, this galaxy is truly massive. But...we must go bigger! This is the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall. With a length of 10 billion light-years (just a little longer than it's name), this is the largest known structure in the Observable Universe. Which leaves us only one thing left... This is the Observable Universe. At approximately 93 billion light-years in diameter, the Observable Universe is insanely massive! But the most shocking... this is only the \"observable\" Universe. The question must be raised, what lies beyond? What has been created so far from us, and how far does it extend? For all we know, it could even extend to infinity. But one thing I do know is that there is a vastness of sizes we can observe that cannot truly be comprehended.

Earth technically isn't a sphere because it's spin flattens it out a little. But that's a topic for another video. This is the moon. A common misconception is that the moon orbits the Earth like this. But this is actually entirely false. The moon isn't anywhere near this close to the Earth, if it were, a full moon would look something like this. Instead, the moon is actually over 363 thousand kilometers  away...at the closest point in its orbit, but because it has an elliptical orbit, its orbit can actually extend beyond 405 thousand kilometers  away! This is certainly far, but it's still really easy to lose reference here. So to put this gigantic distance into perspective a little more, you could fit every other planet in the Solar System in between the Earth and the moon, including gigantic Jupiter! But what's more, you could also fit all of the 5 dwarf planets in the Solar System in there too! And what's even more...there's still over 8 thousand kilometers  left! And what's even more, is that you could fit the Su...wait a minute.

This gigantic star will very, very quickly become comple...wait wrong video. Another misconception is this. This is not the Solar System. This is the Solar System. Ok... that's a bit ridiculous, but it's true. The reason the Solar System is generally shown like this is because... well because you can't really see anything if you illustrate the Solar System like it actually is because the distances are just so far. I mean, let's take the distance from the Sun to Earth for example. If you could travel at the speed of light, you could travel from the Sun to Earth in just...uh about 8 minutes and 19 seconds. Now, for comparison, light can travel around the Earth in less than one seventh of a second. Well...except it doesn't generally travel in a circle...but ignoring that it can travel around the Earth 7 and a half times in 1 second, which means that light could travel around the Earth over 3,700 times in the amount of time it takes light to travel from the Sun to Earth. Now...that's great but, it's still nearly impossible to understand since it's still all numbers which most humans have a difficult time fully comprehending. So... Let's use a different scale. Instead of 1:1, let's use a scale of 1:25,000,000,000. At this scale, the Earth would be about the size of a grain of sand . Now, find a grain of sand and stick it on the tip of your finger, then stick your arms out as straight as you can. Now, find someone else (actually you might want to do that first), and have them stand beside you with their arms straight out as well. Then find another person and have them do the same. Then find another person and have them do the same but have them also balance a tomato on their head . And that is the Earth compared to the Sun...just 25 billion times smaller and may be completely messed up depending on the size of your tomato and the armspan of each person. Now, Jupiter is the largest planet created in the Solar System, but at this scale it would only be about the size of a pea . Oh, and it's distance from the Sun... Well, this one's a bit harder to actually visualize in person because even 25 billion times smaller it's still a pretty large distance. Take your tomato and throw it as far as you possibly can and that is Jupiter compared to the Sun. Although perhaps a better way to visualize this (unless you really dislike tomatoes) would be to set your tomato on the ground and then take the pea up onto the roof of a 10 story building ...and that is Jupiter compared to the Sun. Oh and Jupiter's orbit velocity at this scale would be less than 2 millimeters per hour or less than 2 inches per day! What's a little shocking is that pea sized Saturn , even though it's just one planet over, is nearly double the distance from the Sun , or about the height of an 18 story building ! And, at this scale, the thickness of Saturn's rings would be about the height of just 2 atoms ! Although, the thickest portions of the rings could be nearly 200 atoms thick . Which might sound big but that's less than half the height of a coronavirus. Oh, and for reference, a person at this scale would be about 70 picometers tall. That's about the height of a single helium atom which is the smallest atom we know of! If you stacked a bunch of these tiny people on top of each other, it would take over 7 million  to stretch across a single grain of sand! It is rather shocking that, at a scale so small, Neptune , the farthest major planet from the Sun, would be over 179 meters from the tomato . That's nearly the height of the Space Needle! But this is not the edge of the Solar System! Eris is the farthest dwarf planet from the Sun. At our 1:25 billion scale, Eris would be over 400 meters  away from the tomato sized Sun! Just a little less than the height of the Empire State Building! But this is still not the edge of the Solar System! Eris, Pluto, and many other trans-Neptunian objects, lie in the Kuiper Belt. This belt is estimated to extend nearly 1000 times farther from the Sun than Earth's orbit. 25 billion times smaller, this massive distance would be about 6 kilometers  away! That's farther than 7 Burj Khalifas stacked on top of each other! But this is still not the edge of the Solar System! It is estimated that there are objects orbiting our Sun over 100,000 times farther from the Sun than Earth's orbit! At our scale of 1:25 billion that places the edge of the Solar System 600 kilometers away from our tomato! That's the distance from Berlin to Amsterdam! Remember, Earth is the size of a single grain of sand! Oh, and the size of the observable universe at this scale  would be the distance all the way around the real world Earth over 878 million times ! Or about the real world distance from Earth to the second closest star, Proxima Centauri. Or the real world distance from the Earth to the Sun and back over 100 thousand times ! It's just impossible to comprehend such a massive number! And yet, Earth is still just a single grain of sand.",

		cc:"The speed of sound is about 1235 kilometers per hour or 768 miles per hour . And, no, I'm not going to delay the audio of the entire video like that. But that is what you would have experienced if you were just 150 meters or 500 feet from this video unless, of course, you are in an acoustic shadow zone. But anyway, the reason I say the speed of sound is \"about\" 1235 kilometers per hour is because the speed of sound is not absolute, partially because sound...isn't really \"a thing\". Sound is often compared with light because they are really the two largest building blocks that give us our perception of reality. But, unlike light, sound can't exist on it's own. Light can travel through space all the way from the Sun to Earth without anything there in space. But sound could not. You see, while light was created as electromagnetic radiation and is therefore propagated by electromagnetic waves, sound is composed of mechanical waves. Putting that into simpler terms, light is it's own thing, electric and magnetic fields that are made of photons. It can therefore travel on it's own without anything else around it. But sound is not it's own thing, it requires a medium with which to pass through, otherwise... it simply doesn't exist. As a mechanical wave, sound requires physical interaction between the medium's molecules or their bonds. The best way to visualize sound is with a grid. The grid is the medium (or substance) through which the sound is traveling. The points on the grid are the material's molecules. The lines connecting the dots are the bonds connecting the molecules together. In elastic (or springy) materials, the only materials through which sound can travel, these bonds are compressible. This is what allows sound to propagate so we'll visualize these lines as springs. For simplicity's sake, we'll only visualize one sound wave at a time and at a much slower speed, otherwise...it'd be a confusing mess. There are two types of sound waves, shear waves and compression waves. Shear waves only exist in solids. Liquids and gases don't have shear waves, so for simplicity's sake we'll focus on compression waves. If a sound is created on this side of the material, the sound propagates through the material like this. The amount the wave compresses and stretches the material is the amplitude (or volume) of the sound and the speed of the wave is the speed of sound. This speed varies greatly depending on the material and the material's temperature. This is why there is really no absolute speed of sound. There are a fair number of factors that play into what the speed of sound is for different materials. For solids and liquids the speed of sound is most affected by the material's stiffness and density. For gases, however, it's primarily the temperature and molecular structure of the gas that determines the speed of sound. Air is basically an ideal gas, so the speed of sound in air is primarily affected by the air's temperature. The colder the temperature, the slower the speed of sound, and the hotter the temperature, the faster the speed of sound. At a typical 20 degrees Celsius (or 68 degrees Fahrenheit) the speed of sound through air is about 1235 kilometers per hour or 768 miles per hour or about 0.0001% the speed of light. A common measurement in various fields, such as aerodynamics and ballistics, is Mach number, named after physicist Ernst Mach who captured the first photograph of a bow shockwave on an object traveling faster than the speed of sound. Mach number is not a specific speed but instead the ratio of the object's airspeed to the speed of sound. Mach 1 is always equal to the speed of sound, but, of course, the speed of sound is not always the same. For example 100 kilometers per hour could be Mach 0.081  if the temperature is 20 degrees Celsius or 100 kilometers per hour could be Mach 0.084  if the temperature is 0 degrees Celsius. Anything with a Mach number higher than Mach 1 is supersonic. The fastest manned aircraft ever was the X-15 which traveled at a top speed of 7274 kilometers per hour or 4520 miles per hour which (at an altitude of about 31 kilometers) is Mach 6.7; two times faster than the renowned SR-71 Blackbird! Because of the incredible speed, the surface temperature of the X-15 on some of these missions reached temperatures of over 700 degrees Celsius or 1300 degrees Fahrenheit simply due to friction with the air! The average temperature of Earth's atmosphere varies greatly depending on the altitude. What's interesting about this is that, up to about 11 kilometers, the temperature of the air decreases which causes the speed of sound to decrease as well. This causes an interesting phenomenon where sound is actually refracted upward and thus causes an acoustic shadow some distance from the source of the sound. Wind gradients can also decrease or increase this effect to such an extent that in some cases the sound of war can't even be heard just 3 kilometers away! In fact, on one occasion, during World War 1, a bombardment of German cannon fire could not be heard 50 to 100 kilometers from the source. The sound was heard past the 100 kilometer radius, but anyone inside the 50 to 100 kilometer radius could not hear the explosions. This means that air temperatures and wind gradients refracted the sound first up but then down. These temperature and wind gradients are the reason why some times you will see a flash of lightning, but never hear it. It's not necessarily because you're too far to hear it, it could just be because you're in an acoustic shadow zone. One advantage sound has over light is that, unlike light, sound can travel through almost anything, so long as there is something. We generally think of sound traveling through air, but sound travels through much more than just air. In fact, the speed of sound is generally faster through solid objects than it is through air. Even though the speed of sound through air is generally a fairly slow 1200 kilometers per hour, the speed of sound in steel is 21,600 kilometers per hour or 13,422 miles per hour! The speed of sound through water is also faster than through air at about 5400 kilometers per hour or 3355 miles per hour. Although in steel and water the speed of sound is faster than through air, the speed of sound through rubber is slower than the speed of sound through air at a quite slow 216 kilometers per hour or 134 miles per hour. Diamond compensates for whatever rubber lacks though. Since diamond is one of the stiffest substances we know of, the speed of sound through diamond is one of the fastest possible under normal circumstances. The speed of sound through diamond is an absolutely mind-boggling 43,200 kilometers per hour or 26,843 miles per hour! But this absolutely mind-boggling speed is only 0.004% the speed of light!",

Just comparing it to everything else in the Solar System, it is, quite literally, astronomically gigantic. But as we all know, this gigantic star will very, very quickly become comple...*aggressively clears throat* Since the Sun is so tiny, it makes one wonder what would happen if another star were placed in the center of our Solar System. Whether the star be larger or smaller. For example, Sirius A, the brightest star in our sky (apart from the Sun), would be a little less than 2 times larger than the Sun  but mid day on Earth would be about 23 times brighter and the average temperature would be about 370 degrees Celsius. For comparison, the average temperature on Earth with the Sun at the center of the Solar System is only about 15 degrees Celsius. What's quite shocking is that, if the smallest star we know of (who's name I will not state because...) Anyway, despite this star being smaller than our Sun, and literally smaller than Jupiter and Saturn, if this star were placed in the center of our Solar System, noon on Earth would still be about 3 times brighter than with the Sun at the center. And the average temperature on Earth would be about 110 degrees Celsius. But not all stars smaller than our Sun would produce such results. Our Solar System's closest neighbouring star, Proxima Centauri, is about twice the size  of EBLM J0555-57Ab *aggressively clears throat*... I thought I wasn't going to say that. If Proxima Centauri were placed in the center of our Solar System, the average temperature on Earth would be around -216 degrees Celsius, which is about the temperature on Neptune . Mid day on Earth would be about 20,000 times dimmer. That's over 20 times  dimmer than noon on Neptune with the Sun at the center of the Solar System. Pollux is a very large yet very small star. It's diameter is about 5 times larger than that of Sirius A (or about 9 times that of the Sun). If Pollux were placed in the center of the Solar System, noon on Earth would be about 35 times brighter and the average temperature would be about 430 degrees Celsius. That's nearly the temperature on Venus, the hottest planet in the Solar System! Polaris is over 4 times larger than Pollux  placing the surface of the star about half way to the orbit of Mercury! At this incredible size, mid day on Earth would be over 3000 times brighter than with the Sun at the center of the Solar System, and the average temperature on Earth would be over 1600 degrees Celsius! That's hot enough to melt steel! But, continuing on, Rigel is over 2 times larger than Polaris making it nearly 80 times larger than the Sun and placing its surface at the orbit of Mercury. At such a massive size, mid day on Earth would be nearly 300,000 times brighter and the average temperature on Earth would be over 6000 degrees Celsius! That's hot enough to melt diamond! But, Betelgeuse is significantly larger. From the perspective of Earth, Betelgeuse would... Uhhhhhh....... Betelgeuse would engulf Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and the Asteroid Belt, coming a mere 247 million kilometers  shy of the orbit of Jupiter! ... \"A mere 247 million kilometers\"? ... Despite this star completely engulfing half the Solar System, its surface is still nearly 100 million kilometers farther from Jupiter than the Sun is from Earth! Mid day on Jupiter would be nearly 7000 times brighter than mid day on Earth with the Sun at the center of the Solar System. The average temperature on Jupiter would be nearly 4000 degrees Celsius, compared to the typical -108 degrees Celsius when the Sun is the star in the center of the Solar System. VY Canis Majoris is one of the most commonly known stars because, until recent years, it was the largest star known. At about 1. 9 billion kilometers in diameter, VY Canis Majoris is nearly twice the size of Betelgeuse . If placed in the center of the Solar System, VY Canis Majoris would completely engulf Jupiter's orbit, but its surface would still lie nearly 450 million kilometers  from Saturn, a distance far enough to fit over 300  Suns! The average temperature on Saturn would rise to about 3500 degrees Celsius, compared to the typical -139 degrees Celsius. However, as VY Canis Majoris would be so far from Saturn, noon on Saturn would only be about 18 times brighter than a typical noon on Earth. UY Scuti, the previous record holder for the largest known star, would only be about 17% larger than VY Canis Majoris, but mid day on Saturn would rise to be nearly 10,000 times brighter than a normal noon on Earth. And the average temperature, would increase to around 5,000 degrees Celsius! And now the star we've all been waiting for. The current record holder for the largest known star, Stephenson 2-18, with a diameter over 2000 times larger than the diameter of the Sun, would completely engulf the orbit of Saturn and its surface would only lie...over 1.3 billion kilometers from Uranus. A star so gigantic that it completely engulfs the first 6 planets of the Solar System...would barely even make it halfway  to the orbit of Uranus. But, despite this anticlimactic star trying to destroy my video, noon on Uranus would still be over 3,000 times brighter than a typical noon on Earth. And the average temperature on Uranus would be raised from about -197 degrees Celsius to over 2,000 degrees Celsius. And just knowing the very unsettling fact that Earth is sitting at the center of this star being completely incinerated at 30,000 degrees Celsius, I think it's safe to say that our Solar System was much better designed with the Sun at the center, than with the atrociously monstrous Stephenson 2-18.",

And the size of these incredible constructions are generally only about 2 to 200 micrometers, which is about the thickness of a single human hair! So what is the purpose of these living, microscopic mansions? Well, diatoms are responsible for creating up to 50% of the oxygen produced on Earth each year! Nearly double the amount of oxygen produced by trees!",

		cc:"The Earth is gigantic. But no one really seems to understand just how gigantic it really is. This often leads to all sorts of strange convoluted ideas about what the Earth looks like and how it works. The diameter of Earth is around 12,742 kilometers or 7,918 miles making a circumference of 40,030 kilometers or 24,874 miles. But there's a big problem...what does this even mean? Who even knows what 40 thousand kilometers is? It's a large number...and that's about where it ends. But, fortunately, the video does not end here because the Earth is gigantic more than you can believe. But in order to get a better idea about the scale of the Earth, we're going to need to increase our dimensions. This is any average person standing on the Earth near sea level. Looking across the Earth at eye level you'll see something like this. From this perspective it is impossible to get any idea of how big the Earth is other than just \"big\". But maybe removing some of the visual obstacles will help. Eh, that still looks pretty flat. Well anyway, if we ascend to the tops of the trees...it looks pretty much the same. Even at the very top of the Burj Khalifa (the tallest building in the world), there's not much more to see, with the exception of a few distant mountains. Ascending to the tops of the mountains... there's still no clear reference for the size of the Earth. Even removing the visual obstacles for a clear view of the horizon, the curvature is minimal. I think it's clear at this point that... the Earth is rather large. Ascending to the cruising altitude of airliners, the Earth still looks remarkably flat. But this should come as no surprise for the reason that...the Earth's design is absolutely gigantic. At 100 kilometers (the border of space), the curvature is now quite visible. But even in space the Earth appears to extend on for quite some time. Likely because it's gigantic. Anyway, if we ascend to over four times this altitude, we'll find the International Space Station. At this point, we can clearly see the curvature of the Earth. But, even four times farther than the edge of space you can still only see a small section of the Earth. Here's the thing, though. We're 4 times farther than the border of space but, if we take a bit more than a step back, we can see that we aren't actually that far above the Earth. It almost looks as if we're only a few dozen kilometers above the Earth, not several hundred. Looking at the cruising altitude of airliners from this perspective, it's easy to see why the Earth was looking so flat when we were at that altitude. Viewing the entire Earth certainly gives a different perspective! Speaking of viewing the entire Earth. This is Mt. Everest. Oh what, you don't see it? Well...it's right here. Not like...in the real world but I mean like...that's where it is here...or...I mean it's not like actually... Even viewing it in 8k you can barely see it! And, in reality, it'd be even more difficult to see Mt. Everest because of all the other mountains surrounding it. And, while we're looking at the entire Earth, we might as well try traveling around it. Walking around the Earth would take a full year. Obviously ignoring the water and whatever other obstacles you may encounter. Driving around the Earth at standard highway speeds would take around 2 weeks of continuous driving. Again ignoring any obstacles. Flying around the Earth in an airliner would take 2 full days. Even traveling around the Earth at the speed of sound would take 32 hours! But you might actually be traveling faster than this right now! The Earth is so large that, despite taking nearly 24 hours to make one full rotation, anyone near the equator will be traveling 1674 kilometers per hour or Mach 1.3! Well except that the Earth is also orbiting the Sun and the Sun is orbiting the Milkyway and the... But at least the air is moving along with you so that you're not being faced with supersonic winds. Oh and, fun fact, because of the Earth's spin and its shape you actually weigh less at the equator than at the poles. Your mass is still the same, it's just your weight is less. But the change in weight is very negligible, so you'll likely never know. Anyway, Earth has a surface area of 51 billion hectares. This means that if every person on the Earth were spaced out with equal distances from everyone else, each person would have over 6 hectares entirely for themselves! Well except nearly 71% of Earth is covered with water. But, even only counting the surface area of the land, each person would have over 1.8 hectares all to themselves. Well...and probably some animals, trees, rocks, and whatever else. Ok, but let's try scaling everything down a bit. If you were half the height of a grain of sand, the Earth would be about the height of 450 houses or about the depth of the Grand Canyon or more than twice the height of the Burj Khalifa! Speaking of the Burj Khalifa, at this scale, the Burj Khalifa would be about the height of a lightbulb. Mt. Everest would be only a little taller than a trash bin. And, despite many people thinking the moon isn't nearly as big as it is. At this scale, the Moon would be taller than the Empire State Building. Remember, you are half the height of a grain of sand. Oh, and the Sun at this scale would extend two times farther than the edge of space!",

On this planet, several millions of kilometers from the Sun, there is someone watching an extremely long video demonstrating the size of the Solar System. This is Mars. And this is empty space...yet again. What? All that build up for some...random asteroid. Ah... I guess that must mean we're entering the Asteroid Belt. Oh! There's Ceres!

Between Neptune and Uranus, Uranus has the coldest recorded temperature, but Neptune has the coldest average temperature. So Neptune is technically the coldest. I've only gotten like 473 quintillion comments saying Uranus is the coldest planet... That may or may not have been a slightly major exaggeration. And...there goes Neptune. The last major planet, but far from the edge of the Solar System! And here's Pluto. The largest dwarf planet. And yes, Pluto is larger than Eris. Pluto is 44 kilometers larger in diameter than Eris, making it the largest dwarf planet. I only received a few billion comments about that... Or maybe more like a few dozen, but anyway.. This is Haumea! A very flat dwarf planet. That was Makemake. Just in case you couldn't read. And I guess our exploration will have to end here. During this time around 7 meteorites passed through the atmosphere and hit Earth, around 539 earthquakes have occurred, about 152,000 people were born, there have about 3. 4 million lightning strikes, and Jupiter has experienced nearly an entire day .

		cc:"That was a very pathetic 0.14 joules of energy. Not anything to be concerned about except maybe if you're a flea. But something that releases much more energy is a clap which is around 11 joules. Still not much to be concerned about. But the blow of a hammer  is much more powerful. At around 60 joules, the blow of a hammer is enough energy to easily fracture glass, bones, and even rocks. A firecracker releases even more energy at around 150 joules.  But none of this is nearly as powerful as you. Running full speed, an average person has around 1500 joules of energy. So...probably don't run top speed into a brick wall because...my interpretation of my moderately deplorable comprehension capabilities says...that will hurt. Anyway, it's time to drastically increase in energy...with a bang. The muzzle energy of a cannon is around 560,000 joules, strong enough to destroy almost anything in the cannonball's path. Just a bit higher is a firework with around 600,000 joules. A car, traveling at standard highway speeds, has around 815, 000 joules. An SUV traveling at the same speed would have around 1 megajoule or 1 million joules. 1 kilogram of TNT releases about 4.2 megajoules. A fully loaded semi-truck traveling at typical truck speeds has around 14 megajoules of energy. So if you were ever wondering if you could brake-check a semi-truck and actually stop it...the answer is no. But don't worry because there is something else that you stand even less chance of stopping. A freight train. When traveling at the standard freight train speed, a train has around 4 gigajoules of energy or around 4 billion joules or about 286 semi-trucks or nearly 1 ton of TNT. 1 ton of TNT being about 4.2 gigajoules. Nature isn't going to be left out though. One of the most powerful events that regularly occurs in nature is lightning at 7 gigajoules or 1.7 tons of TNT. It's no wonder it's so incredibly loud. But, on April 26, 1986, an event much worse than a lightning strike occurred in eastern Europe. The worst nuclear disaster ever, commonly known as the Chernobyl disaster which released the equivalent of around 10 tons of TNT. But, the disaster was more a danger of radiation rather than of the actual explosion itself. Something that did have a very deadly explosion, however, was Little Boy, the atomic bomb which destroyed Hiroshima. This explosion was the equivalent of around 15 kilotons of TNT. Much higher, though less deadly due to it being located deep in mostly uninhabited forest, was the Tunguska Event . On June 30, 1908, a flash of light nearly as bright as the Sun was seen in the far distance. Then, around 10 minutes later, a huge, distant explosion was heard with an accompanying shock wave so powerful that it shattered windows and even knocked people off their feet hundreds of kilometers away. Due to the remoteness of the event, it has remained largely unstudied. Even today it is unknown what caused the explosion, though it is widely accepted that its probable cause was from an asteroid which exploded midair. Regardless of what caused it, this event is best calculated to be equivalent to 30 megatons of TNT. About as much as 2000 atomic bombs! Well..2000 ordinary atomic bombs. The Tsar Bomba  was the largest atomic bomb ever detonated. The resulting explosion being equivalent to around 50 megatons of TNT, over 3000 times greater than an ordinary atomic bomb. The Tsar Bomba is still the largest explosion ever made by humans. But humans, despite all their disastrous creations, will never be able to come close to the forces of many creations in nature. On May 18, 1980, Mt. Saint Helens erupted releasing the equivalent of around 410 megatons of TNT, more than 8 times that of the Tsar Bomba! This eruption remains, to this day, the deadliest volcanic event in the history of the United States. But it's certainly not the most powerful natural disaster. The eruption of Mt. Tambora, in 1815, was far more powerful releasing the equivalent of around 33 gigatons of TNT or about 2. 2 million atomic bombs! But, this is still not the most powerful natural disaster. On May 22, 1960, a massive earthquake occurred off the coast of Chile releasing the equivalent of around 17.2 thousand gigatons of TNT or about 1.1 billion atomic bombs! This earthquake was so powerful that it sent tsunamis all the way across the entire Pacific Ocean causing hundreds of deaths even as far as Japan! This earthquake was the most powerful ever recorded and is likely the most powerful natural disaster in recorded history.",

A planet which has areas so hostile that missions to those areas have resulted in some of the most horrific disasters humans have witnessed. Despite mapping the entire surface of Mars with a resolution of just 200 meters per pixel, most of this mysterious planet has only been mapped at a resolution of 1.5 kilometers per pixel. This mysterious planet, is Earth. Despite centuries of exploration and research by billions of people, we still know very little about our own planet. In fact, one of the most mysterious things about Earth, is one of the most abundant. The ocean is huge! And by huge, I mean HUGE! Over 80% of the ocean is completely unexplored by humans. To put that into perspective, if that 80% were the land, every country except Russia and China would be completely unexplored, even the entirety of North America, South America, Europe, Australia, and even Africa! But why is water so hostile? Isn't it required for life? Water is great until you have too much, and while there isn't too much water on Earth, there can certainly be too much water above you. This makes it incredibly difficult to explore the ocean. You see, while you can just walk outside and explore the land, you can't just go jump in the ocean and swim around. Sure, you can swim around near the surface, but if you want to go any deeper than a few meters, you're going to need something to breath because, fun fact, you can't really breath water. But, even with some sort of breathing apparatus to help you breath, you still can't go deeper than a few dozen meters. Fortunately, submarines, or rather submersibles, were specifically designed to be submersed in water, making them a great tool for exploring the ocean. But...there's a problem. Actually...there's far more than one. Submersibles are incredibly not good for exploring the ocean. They require a significant amount of knowledge and skill to operate and maintain, so you're probably not going to be building one yourself. And, not only are they extremely expensive themselves, they often require an entire ship for deployment as well. And, even if you can get past all the first obstacles, most submersibles can only go a few hundred or maybe a couple thousand meters which leaves nearly 70 percent of the ocean beyond reach. But there's an even bigger problem. Most submersibles, designed for research and exploration, can only travel a mere 3 knots which, to be clear, is about the average walking pace. This isn't a huge issue since, only being able to see a few meters in front of you, you'll probably not want to go any faster. Except...with such a slow speed and low visibility, even if you had a fleet of a thousand submarines, it would take a year just to glance over everything. Well...to glance over the floor of the ocean, not even counting all the space between the surface and the ocean floor. To properly study everything would take far longer. Not to mention the troublesome fact that only a few dozen exploration submersibles have even been built, and many are no longer in service. Granted, there are a lot of robotic underwater vehicles, but most of them are used for industrial purposes, not exploration, and many designed for exploration still can't go much deeper than a human. To put into perspective just how unexplored the ocean is, more people have been to space than have visited the Titanic wreck site, and even fewer have been to the deepest part of the ocean. We know so little about our own ocean that around 2 thousand new marine species are discovered every year or more than 5 every single day. But, despite how much we still don't know about our own planet, there are still some incredible things which we do know. The ocean is home to the longest mountain range on Earth, the Ocean Ridge which has a total length of 80,000 kilometers, about 9 times longer than the Andes. The ocean is also home to the largest canyon, the Mariana Trench, which is about 70 times larger than the Grand Canyon. The ocean is home to Mauna Kea , the tallest mountain from base to peak, being about 5% taller than Mt. Everest's height above sea level. The ocean is home to about 80% of Earth's volcanic eruptions. And as far as animals are concerned, the ocean is home to the largest and heaviest animal, the most intelligent animal apart from humans, the largest invertebrate and the animal with the largest eyes (which we currently have no confirmed videos or photos of), and tons of other animals which are amazing! There are over 240,000 known marine species which is more than 6 times the number of species of mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians combined! Not to mention the possible 2 million others which have yet to be discovered. So I think it's safe to say that the ocean is home to some of the most diverse and strangely designed creatures on Earth. Just a few of these being the barreleye fish which has a literal transparent head. Talk about \"I can see right through you\"... The oarfish which looks like some sort of metallic robot and is the longest bony fish. This is not the creation of some ancient civilization, it's the creation of the white-spotted pufferfish. The Japanese spider crab which is enough to give me nightmares. The giant isopod which... The black dragonfish which is uh...uh... This thing which looks like some sort of deep sea lizard fish something. Oh wait...that's what it's called, well minus the something part. This thing which also seems to struggle eating spaghetti or... wait that's not spaghetti. This guy who somehow has RGB lighting on himself. And thousands of other insane looking creatures which unfortunately just didn't make the list, mainly because...there are thousands. I think it goes without saying, but the mere fact that only 20% or less of the ocean has been explored, and most of this being the deep ocean, there is no telling what amazing creatures, ancient artifacts, geological features, and other stuff is down there. I mean, the black dragonfish wasn't discovered until 1906 and the barreleye fish wasn't discovered until 1939 with many other odd looking marine creatures discovered just within the past couple decades. As fascinating as space is, there is an arguably more diverse and surprising world far closer to us. Although, it feels like anything I look at in the natural world just keeps getting more amazing the more I read or even discover on my own. As impressive as some of the creations of humans are, I always seem to find that it completely fades into nothingness when compared to the creations that came far before them. Even as niche and unnatural as RGB lighting, \"Nature had it first.\"",

You speak this language before you're born and even after you're dead. You never stop speaking this language until you cease to exist. This language is scent. We normally think of something's scent as smelling good or bad, or if you have an even better nose, you may be able to tell the difference between things which stink,  smell sweet, sour, minty and other slightly more complex smells. But there is so much more to scents than just these, so much more in fact, that you can almost consider it an entire language. You, whether dead or alive, are constantly emitting a certain scent, no matter how much deodorant you put on this morning. But did you know that you actually have relatively fast control over how you smell? Well, not like whether are not you stink, but the other scents you emit. Mainly, your emotional scents. Compared to most other mammals, humans have pretty poor olfaction (or sense of smell), so we never notice that someone smells different when they're scared or angry. Dogs, on the other hand, can smell these differences because they have an incredible sense of smell. Their sense of smell is so good, in fact, that they can smell a person from up to 20 kilometers away or detect substances at concentrations as low as 1 part per trillion. In human terms, that's like being able to immediately spot the one dead pixel on the Las Vegas Sphere's interior screen. *clears throat* Sorry, in human terms, that's like being able to immediately spot the one dead pixel on one of 3906 Las Vegas Sphere interior screens. But if you think that's crazy, just wait to you hear about silkmoths. Actually, no need to wait, 'cause I'm gonna tell you right now. A male silkmoth can detect certain smells at concentrations as low as 1 part per 100 quadrillion. In human terms, that's like being able to find a needle in a literal haystack...*clears throat* a haystack of 14 billion bales or about like finding the 3 needles I put in random places somewhere in the Sahara Desert or like finding the actual content on this webpage that I can't even... But how does smelling even work? How does something emit a smell and what is in my nose that allows me to somehow detect and generally identify that smell? Well, that is about as complex a question as asking me what I'm doing. To explain it in a somewhat basic way, an object emits a smell or odor because it has volatile organic compounds, or VOCs. These compounds easily evaporate at room temperature, hence the term volatile. Kind of how water evaporates, except, unlike water, these compounds are composed of odorous molecules, causing the compound to smell. As the compound evaporates, it releases these odorous molecules into the air. Then these molecules bind to receptor proteins extending from cilia in your nose which are connected to olfactory receptor neurons. This causes electrical signals to travel from the olfactory nerves to the olfactory bulb which is part of the olfactory cortex. The olfactory cortex is the part of the brain which processes and interprets smells. The smells are largely interpreted by associating them with memories or emotions which is why some odors can smell good to one person and bad to another. It simply depends on what memory your brain connects the smell to. We can tell the difference between smells because of the signals sent from the olfactory receptors, such as what combination of signals were sent. For example, if I showed you this sequence of red and white squares, you'd have no idea what it was. But if we arrange those squares like this, you can pretty easily tell what the squares mean. As you learn more and more sequences of squares, you will be able to quickly identify any number or shape simply by the sequence of squares. This is basically the same with smell. At the beginning of your life you associate certain signals with certain objects, such as food, and then you remember these connections for years, thus allowing you to determine what a smell is from. This is really a gross oversimplification because there is so much more that this whole smelling process involves, but I think if I were to fully explain it, both you and I would look something like this. Anyway, smells can be used as a way of communicating silently and invisibly. These types of odors are called pheromones. Many animals use pheromones to communicate between each other. Honeybees release a pheromone when the hive is in danger, silently summoning more bees to their aid. Ants release pheromones to mark paths to food sources, thus giving a fast, accurate, and completely invisible message to the other ants. Even some aquatic animals use pheromones. Some catfish, for example, release a pheromone, when in danger, which alerts other nearby catfish. It has been found that humans also release pheromones or rather emotion and mood related scents, the question is, can we detect them? While we're pretty certain that humans can't detect them consciously, it is still unknown if we can detect them subconsciously. Have you ever had that feeling that someone was watching you, but you couldn't see anyone, and then later on you find out that there was in fact someone watching you? Pheromones and other smells can travel insane distances. Some moths release pheromones which can travel hundreds of meters possibly even several kilometers and polar bears can smell seals from over 30 kilometers away! What if humans emit odors which basically send an invisible message that tells everything going on in their mind, such as what they're looking at, and then you subconsciously detect those odors so that you can tell that someone is watching you. Humans can detect around 1 trillion different smells, more than enough smells to get a pretty good idea of what someone is thinking if thoughts do indeed produce pheromones. It sounds completely outrageous, and for the most part it is, but we technically haven't proven that this isn't true. Although, since animals generally can't tell if you're looking at them, and they have much better noses than humans, it's unlikely that this is the case. That being said, maybe they just can't interpret our odors to know what they mean. I, personally, feel like there is something that allows you to subconsciously detect someone's presence even at a significant distance, whether that be the faintest air currents from their breath, the faintest temperature change from their body heat, the faintest electromagnetic wave from their brain, or the faintest scents they're releasing. Whatever the case, the extremely complex design of our nose and brain, and really the whole smelling process, really demonstrates just how much stuff is happening all around us and inside us that we so easily take for granted. From the polar bear smelling 30 kilometers away to the silkmoth with its 3 needles in the Sahara Desert like odor detection, I feel like my olfactory acuity is very much lacking. But at least I'm not stuck in the arctic being seally or stuck trying to find a moth in the dark some hundred meters away by smell.",

		cc:"Did you know that the Earth is upside-down? Earth has a north pole and a south pole, just like a giant magnet. Except...it's not actually the way most people think it is. What we call the \"North Pole\" is actually the south pole, and what we call the \"South Pole\" is actually the north pole. If you know anything about magnets you'll know that the north pole of a magnet will not face the north pole of another magnet (at least not without significant force). This is why we call the Earth's south pole the \"North Pole\". Because the north pole of a compass faces the south pole of the Earth. But the \"North Pole\" is in fact Earth's south pole. But it'd be really confusing if you started reversing the names of the poles so it's probably best to call the North and South Pole by their normal but definitely inaccurate names.",

		cc:"Ahh...isn't a perfectly clear sky just so beautiful? Why does the Sun look so small though? Wait...wait...what?! *clears throat* So basically we're gonna see what it would look like on other planets. Starting with the closest to the Sun, Mercury. So here we are on Mercury. That's a bit bright, let me turn down my exposure. The Sun obviously appears much larger here than it does on Earth, and thus much brighter. Mercury has no atmosphere, no moons, and some very extreme temperatures. Daytime temperatures can reach highs of 430 degrees Celsius with nighttime temperatures dipping down as low as -180 degrees Celsius, the average temperature being 167 degrees Celsius. Why do I sound like the weather radio... Anyway, Mercury makes one full rotation in about 58 Earth days,  which is a pretty long day. But, because Mercury orbits the Sun so fast—about once every 88 Earth days—the actual day length on Mercury is 175 Earth days, , which...is a very long time for a single day. Imagine working 2800 hour days, or since a year on Mercury is shorter than its day, imagine working 1.3 year days. What... This odd effect also causes the Sun to briefly appear to reverse direction during the day. If you know anything about the Solar System you know which planet is next, and that is Venus. Unlike Mercury, Venus has an atmosphere and a thick and deadly one at that. The atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide with clouds composed of sulfuric acid. This is literally the image you get in your head when you think of a deadly planet. In fact it's so deadly that out of the 10 landers which have successfully landed on Venus, most lasted less than an hour and the longest time survived was just 2 hours and 7 minutes. When you have hurricane-force winds, atmospheric pressures equal to being 1 kilometer underwater, and temperatures hot enough to melt lead...eh let's just say even electronics don't really stand a chance. But, Venus is special for more reasons than just being incredibly hostile. From Earth, Venus is the third brightest object in the sky, with only the Moon and Sun being brighter. At night on Earth, if there's no ambient light, such as the Moon, Venus is actually bright enough to cast shadows! And, I was even able to photograph it during the middle of the day once! Speaking of brightness, this is what it would look like here at our normal Earth exposure. Venus is also special because it's the hottest planet in the Solar System, is almost the same size as Earth, and it spins backwards making the Sun rise in the west and set in the east. Not that you can see it very well since the atmosphere is so dense, but anyway... Onward to Earth! That sounds strange... Most of us know what this looks like already so it's actually a bit boring compared to what we've just seen, not to mention the fact that my 3D modelling skills are kind of terrible so this looks pretty bad. Average temperatures are about what you'd expect. There is one thing that's quite a bit different about this planet than all the others and that is, of course, life! The vast amount of life forms on Earth as well as their vastly different and often unique designs are what really make this place stand out from the rest and feel like home. Unlike the other planets, Earth isn't quite so hostile. (atomic bomb explosion) I take that back and we're moving on. Here we are on Mars. This planet has been studied quite a lot. The temperatures range from -153 degrees Celsius at night, to 35 degrees Celsius during the day, with the average temperature being around -63 degrees Celsius. Mars is special because its day length is just 40 minutes longer than Earth's day length of 24 hours. Oh, and Mars has 2 Moons, Phobos and Deimos. Phobos orbits Mars faster than Mars itself rotates, this makes it appear that Phobos rises in the west and sets in the east. I.e. it appears to go backwards in the sky. Also, quick Earth exposure as a reference before we continue. It is starting to get noticeably darker as we get farther from the Sun. Quick side trip while we're looking at stuff, this is the Sun from Ceres. Not anything particularly special except that it is getting noticeably darker, but just for anyone curious, this is about what it'd look like. You'll notice that you can't really see any other asteroids, and that's simply because despite there being millions of asteroids, the asteroids are spread out over such a large area of space that the distances between them are extremely large. This is why we can send spacecraft though the asteroid belt with basically no worries of it colliding with an asteroid. Anyway, on to Jupiter! This is our first gas giant, so there's technically no surface, you're just levitating in the air, or whatever you want to call this stuff. We're now over 5 times farther from the Sun than Earth, so it is considerably darker, which basically means I need to boost my exposure so that we can actually see stuff. You might've noticed that it's incredibly windy here, and that's a trend you'll notice with all the gas and ice giants. The temperature here averages about -108 degrees Celsius. Jupiter is very special being the largest planet in the Solar System and spinning the fastest with a day lasting just under 10 hours. Light from the Sun takes over 43 minutes to reach Jupiter! If you didn't know that, I'd recommend going and watching my 9 hour long vid... Guess what, it's Saturn time! With a fairly major exposure boost this planet will give you perhaps the most interesting view with the rings looking so incredibly beautiful and dreamlike. It's almost hard to believe that this is real. Eh...well I... I mean it's not... well...well it is but it's like... like...not...this...this video... whatever. The average temperature here is about -139 degrees Celsius. And Saturn has the most moons of any planet in the Solar System, 146 moons! Ahh...gotta take at least a minute to absorb this incredible view though, am I right? Ha! Nope! We've got more planets to go to! I can literally barely see. But, here's the Sun from Uranus. The average temperature here is about -197 degrees Celsius. Uranus holds the record for the coldest recorded temperature out of all the 8 planets. Neptune is still colder on average, though. And here we are on Neptune. The last of the 8 major planets and one with some terribly fast winds. These winds whip clouds of frozen methane across the planet at speeds of over 2,000 kilometers per hour! The average temperature here is about -201 degrees Celsius. The average brightness here, in the middle of the day, is very low being about 9,000 times darker than noon on Earth. Let me reset my exposure to what we used on Earth so you can see just how dark it is here. At this distance, the Sun is so tiny that it's almost hard to believe we're orbiting it. Before we end, let's take a quick peek at the last 4 dwarf planets, just for fun. This is Pluto. It's very dark here. This is Haumea. Also, very dark. Who would've guessed... Oh and I should probably specify that we don't actually know a whole lot about these last 3 dwarf planets so, this is about what it looks like but it might also not be. Here's Makemake. Not too much farther than Haumea and Pluto. And lastly, Eris. Over 10 billion kilometers from the Sun. It's basically the middle of space now, or at least it sure feels like it. But that's basically it! You know, if this video wasn't boring enough for you, you should go and watch my 9 hour long vid...",
