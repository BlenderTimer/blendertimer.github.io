					<p>Have you ever wondered just how many people stub their toe every day? With over 8 billion people on the planet, every time you stub your toe, there are around 15,700 other people who stubbed their toe at that very second! At least...as far as we can figure. Finding the exact value for such an obscure statistic would be impossible, but we can get a close estimate. To figure this odd statistic out, I polled a few thousand people on how many times they stub their toe.</p>
					<img src="/data/images/distribution-of-how-often-people-stub-their-toes.png" alt="Distribution of how often people stub their toes" class="data-image">
					<p>Of the 2,866 people in the survey, 62% stubbed their toe a few times a year or less, 23% stubbed their toe a few times a month, 9% stubbed their toe a few times a week, 2% stubbed their toe once per day, and 4% stubbed their toe more than once per day.<a class="ref" onclick="scrollToNote('ref1')">1</a></p>
					<br><br>
					<p>If we use some basic math and make a few assumptions, we can make a rough calculation of how many people stub their toe every day. Assuming "more than once per day" is an average of 2 times per day, "a few" is 3 times for the week and month statistic, and "a few or less" for the year statistic is an average of 2 times per year, we can calculate how many people stub their toe per day (also assuming the world's population is around 8.25 billion<a class="ref" onclick="scrollToNote('ref2')">2</a> and a month is 30 days). That all calculates down to around 1.36 billion people stubbing their toes every single day, or 56.7 million people every hour, or 945 thousand every minute, or 15.7 thousand every second.</p>
					<br><br>
					<p>Of course, there are many caveats to this statistic. First and foremost, this is entirely based on what people <i>think</i> they do, this does not necessarily represent what the people <i>actually</i> do. Secondly, this is from a poll on YouTube which could mean that most of these people are not very physically active in the real world. This could skew the statistics either higher or lower as more active people may stub their toe more (since they move around more and thus have more opportunities to stub their toe), or more active people may stub their toe less (since they may have better balance, reflexes, etc. than non-active people). It's really hard to know. However, this statistic still represents just how many people may be <i>literally</i> sharing your pain every time you stub your toe.</p>
